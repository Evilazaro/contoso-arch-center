# Guidelines for Reference Architectures on Contoso Architecture Center

## What is a Reference Architecture?

The term *reference architecture* means a lot of things, but in the context of the Contoso Architecture Center, it refers to a specific type of guidance artifact, found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures).

Our reference architectures focus on real-world scenarios. Each reference architecture consists of:

- A diagram of the architecture.
- A set of recommendations and best practices.
- A deployable solution.

Some reference architectures are part of a series. Within a series, the architectures may build on each other. For example:

1. Single VM
2. Load balanced VMs
3. N-tier architecture
4. Multi-region n-tier architecture

In other cases, the series contains a set of recommended alternatives for a single scenario. In that case, we include additional guidance to help customers select which reference architecture meets their needs. For example:

1. Hybrid network with VPN Gateway
2. Hybrid network with ExpressRoute
