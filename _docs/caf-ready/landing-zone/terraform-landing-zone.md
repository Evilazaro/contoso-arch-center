# Use Terraform to build your landing zones

Azure provides native services for deploying your landing zones. Terraform by HashiCorp is a third-party tool that can help with this effort. This article shows how to deploy foundational governance, accounting, and security capabilities for an Azure subscription using a sample landing zone.

## Purpose of the landing zone

The Cloud Adoption Framework foundations landing zone for Terraform can enforce logging, accounting, and security. This landing zone uses standard components known as *Terraform modules*. The modules enforce consistency across resources deployed in the environment.

## Use standard modules

Reuse of components is a fundamental principle of infrastructure as code. Modules are instrumental in defining standards and consistency across resource deployment within and across environments. To get the modules to deploy this first landing zone, see the official [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/aztfmod).

## Architecture diagram

The first landing zone deploys the following components in your subscription:

## Capabilities

The deployed components fill the following responsibilities:

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Resource groups | Core resource groups needed for the foundation |
| Activity logging | Auditing all subscription activities and archiving: <li> Storage account <li> Azure Event Hubs |
| Diagnostics logging | All operation logs kept for a specific number of days: <li> Storage account <li> Event Hubs |
| Log Analytics | Stores the operation logs. Deploy common solutions for deep application best practices review: <li> `NetworkMonitoring` <li> `AdAssessment` <li> `AdReplication` <li> `AgentHealthAssessment` <li> `DnsAnalytics` <li> `KeyVaultAnalytics` |
| Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Security hygiene metrics and alerts sent to email and phone number |

## Use this blueprint

Before you use the Cloud Adoption Framework foundation landing zone, review the following assumptions, decisions, and implementation guidance.

### Assumptions

Review the following assumptions or constraints for this initial landing zone. If these assumptions align with your needs, you can use the blueprint to create a landing zone. Or, you can extend this blueprint to create a landing zone blueprint that meets your needs.

- **Subscription limits:** This adoption effort is unlikely to exceed [subscription limits](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits). Two common indicators are an excess of 25,000 virtual machines or 10,000 vCPUs.
- **Compliance:** No third-party compliance requirements are needed for this landing zone.
- **Architectural complexity:** Architectural complexity doesn't require more production subscriptions.
- **Shared services:** No existing shared services in Azure require this subscription to be treated like a spoke in a hub-and-spoke architecture.

If these assumptions match your current environment, this blueprint might be a good way to start building your landing zone.

### Design decisions

The following decisions are represented in the CAF Terraform modules:

| Component              | Decisions                                                | Alternative approaches |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Logging and monitoring | Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace is used. A diagnostics storage account and an event hub is provisioned. | |
| Network                | N/A. Network is implemented in another landing zone. | [Networking decisions](../considerations/networking-options.md) |
| Identity               | It's assumed that the subscription is already associated with an Azure Active Directory instance. | [Identity management best practices](/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-best-practices) |
| Policy                 | This landing zone currently assumes that no Azure policies are to be applied. | |
| Subscription design    | N/A. This landing zone is designed for a single production subscription. | [Create initial subscriptions](../azure-best-practices/initial-subscriptions.md) |
| Resource groups        | N/A. This landing zone is designed for a single production subscription.  | [Scale subscriptions](../azure-best-practices/scale-subscriptions.md)  |
| Management groups      | N/A. This landing zone is designed for a single production subscription.   | [Organize subscriptions](../azure-best-practices/organize-subscriptions.md)  |
| Data                   | N/A         | [Choose the correct SQL Server option in Azure](/azure/azure-sql/azure-sql-iaas-vs-paas-what-is-overview) and [Azure data store guidance](/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/data-store-overview) |
| Storage                | N/A | [Azure Storage guidance](../considerations/storage-options.md)  |
| Naming standards       | When the environment is created, a unique prefix is also created. Resources that require a globally unique name, such as storage accounts, use this prefix. The custom name is appended with a random suffix. Tag usage is mandated as described in the following table. | [Naming and tagging best practices](../azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging.md) |
| Cost management        | N/A              | [Tracking costs](../azure-best-practices/track-costs.md)     |
| Compute                | N/A          | [Compute options](/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-tree)  |

#### Tagging standards

The minimum set of tags shown below must be present on all resources and resource groups:

| Key               | Description                      | Example values |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| `BusinessUnit`    | Top-level division of your company that owns the subscription or workload the resource belongs to. | `finance`, `marketing`, `<product-name>`, `corp`, `shared` |
| `CostCenter`      | Accounting cost center associated with this resource. | `<cost-center-number>` |
| `DR`              | Business criticality of the application, workload, or service.  | `dr-enabled`, `non-dr-enabled` |
| `Env`             | Deployment environment of the application, workload, or service. | `prod`, `dev`, `qa`, `staging`, `test`, `training` |
| `Owner`           | Owner of the application, workload, or service. | `<email>` |
| `DeploymentType`  | Defines how the resources are being maintained. | `manual`, `terraform` |
| `Version`         | Version of the blueprint deployed. | `v0.1` |
| `ApplicationName` | Name of the associated application, service, or workload associated with the resource. | `<app-name>` |

## Customize and deploy your first landing zone

You can [clone your Terraform foundation landing zone](https://github.com/azure/caf-terraform-landingzones). Get started easily with the landing zone by modifying the Terraform variables. In our example, we use **blueprint_foundations.sandbox.auto.tfvars**, so Terraform automatically sets the values in this file for you.

Let's look at the different variable sections.

In this first object, we create two resource groups in the `southeastasia` region named `-hub-core-sec` and `-hub-operations` along with a prefix added at runtime.

```hcl
resource_groups_hub = {
    HUB-CORE-SEC    = {
        name = "-hub-core-sec"
        location = "southeastasia"
    }
    HUB-OPERATIONS  = {
        name = "-hub-operations"
        location = "southeastasia"
    }
}
```

Next, we specify the regions where we can set the foundations. Here, `southeastasia` is used to deploy all the resources.

```hcl
location_map = {
    region1   = "southeastasia"
    region2   = "eastasia"
}
```

Then, we specify the retention period for the operations logs and the Azure subscription logs. This data is stored in separate storage accounts and an event hub. The account and event hub names are randomly generated because they must be unique.

```hcl
azure_activity_logs_retention = 365
azure_diagnostics_logs_retention = 60
```

Into the `tags_hub`, we specify the minimum set of tags that are applied to all resources created.

```hcl
tags_hub = {
    environment     = "DEV"
    owner           = "Arnaud"
    deploymentType  = "Terraform"
    costCenter      = "65182"
    BusinessUnit    = "SHARED"
    DR              = "NON-DR-ENABLED"
}
```

We specify the Log Analytics name and a set of solutions that analyze the deployment. We kept network monitoring, Active Directory assessment and replication, DNS Analytics, and Key Vault analytics.

```hcl

analytics_workspace_name = "lalogs"

solution_plan_map = {
    NetworkMonitoring = {
        "publisher" = "Microsoft"
        "product"   = "OMSGallery/NetworkMonitoring"
    },
    ADAssessment = {
        "publisher" = "Microsoft"
        "product"   = "OMSGallery/ADAssessment"
    },
    ADReplication = {
        "publisher" = "Microsoft"
        "product"   = "OMSGallery/ADReplication"
    },
    AgentHealthAssessment = {
        "publisher" = "Microsoft"
        "product"   = "OMSGallery/AgentHealthAssessment"
    },
    DnsAnalytics = {
        "publisher" = "Microsoft"
        "product"   = "OMSGallery/DnsAnalytics"
    },
    KeyVaultAnalytics = {
        "publisher" = "Microsoft"
        "product"   = "OMSGallery/KeyVaultAnalytics"
    }
}

```

Next, we configured the alert parameters for Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

```hcl
# Azure Security Center Configuration

security_center = {
    contact_email   = "joe@contoso.com"
    contact_phone   = "+6500000000"
}
```

## Take action

After you've reviewed the configuration, you can deploy the configuration as you would deploy a Terraform environment. We recommend that you use the rover. The rover is a Docker container that allows deployment from Windows, Linux, or macOS. You can get started with the [landing zones](https://github.com/azure/caf-terraform-landingzones).

## Next steps

The foundation landing zone lays the groundwork for a complex environment in a decomposed manner. This edition provides a set of simple capabilities. You can extend the capabilities by adding other modules or layering other landing zones on top of it.

It's a good practice to layer your landing zones. That practice helps decouple systems, version each component that you're using, and allows fast innovation and stability for your infrastructure-as-code deployment.

Future reference architectures will demonstrate this concept for a hub and spoke topology.
