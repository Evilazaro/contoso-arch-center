# Subscriptions

Subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale within Azure. Subscriptions play a critical role when you're designing for large-scale Azure adoption. This information helps you capture subscription requirements and design target subscriptions based on critical factors. These factors are based on environment type, ownership and governance model, organizational structure, and application portfolios.

## Subscriptions considerations

### Subscription organization and governance design considerations

- Subscriptions serve as boundaries for assigning Azure policies.

  - For example, secure workloads such as Payment Card Industry (PCI) workloads typically require other policies to achieve compliance. Instead of using a management group to collate workloads that require PCI compliance, you can achieve the same isolation with a subscription. This way, you don't have too many management groups with a few subscriptions.

    - If you need to group together a number of subscriptions that are of the same workload archetype, creating them under a management group is the recommended approach.

- Subscriptions serve as a scale unit so component workloads can scale within the platform [subscription limits](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits). Make sure you consider subscription resource limits during your workload design sessions.

- Subscriptions provide a management boundary for governance and isolation, which clearly separates concerns.

- Use the manual process to limit an Azure AD tenant to only Enterprise Agreement enrollment subscriptions. This process prevents creation of Microsoft Developer Network subscriptions at the root management group scope.
  - For support, reach out via an [Azure Support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/)

- See the [Azure subscription and reservation transfer hub](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-transfer) for transfers of subscriptions between Azure billing offers.

### Subscription quota and capacity design considerations

Azure regions might have a finite number of resources. As a result, the available capacity and SKUs should be tracked for Azure adoptions that have a large number of resources.

- Consider [limits and quotas](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) within the Azure platform for each service that your workloads require.

- Consider the availability of required SKUs within chosen Azure regions. For example, new features might be available only in certain regions. The availability of certain SKUs for given resources such as VMs might be different from one region to another.

- Consider that subscription quotas aren't capacity guarantees and are applied on a per-region basis.

  - See [On-demand capacity reservation (preview)](/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overview) for virtual machine capacity reservations.

### Subscription tenant transfer restrictions design considerations

Each Azure subscription is linked to a single Azure AD tenant, which acts as an identity provider (IdP) for the Azure subscription. The Azure AD tenant is used to authenticate users, services, and devices.

The Azure AD tenant linked to the Azure subscription can be changed by a user with the required permissions. This process is detailed in the following articles:

- [Associate or add an Azure subscription to your Azure Active Directory tenant](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory)
- [Transfer an Azure subscription to a different Azure AD directory](/azure/role-based-access-control/transfer-subscription)

> [!NOTE]
> For Azure Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscriptions, transferring to another Azure AD tenant is not supported.

With Azure landing zones, you have the option to set requirements to prevent users from transferring subscriptions to your organization's Azure AD tenant. Review the process in [Manage Azure subscription policies](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/manage-azure-subscription-policy).

Configure the subscription policy by providing a list of [exempted users](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/manage-azure-subscription-policy#exempted-users). Exempted users are permitted to bypass what's set in the policy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not an [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview).

- Consider whether users with [Visual Studio/MSDN Azure subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/) should be allowed to transfer their subscription to or from the Azure AD tenant.

- These settings are only configurable by users with the Azure AD [Global Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator) role assigned and must have [elevated their access](/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin) to change the policy.

  - Only individual user accounts can be specified as [exempted users](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/manage-azure-subscription-policy#exempted-users). Azure AD groups aren't supported.

- All users with access to Azure can view the policy defined for the Azure AD tenant.

  - Users can't view the [exempted users](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/manage-azure-subscription-policy#exempted-users).

  - Users can view the global administrators within the Azure AD tenant.

- Azure subscriptions transferred into an Azure AD tenant will be placed into the [default management group](/azure/governance/management-groups/how-to/protect-resource-hierarchy#setting---default-management-group) for that tenant.

- The application team might define a process to allow Azure subscriptions to be transferred to or from an Azure AD tenant, if approved by the organization.

### Establish cost management design considerations

Cost transparency is a critical management challenge faced by every large enterprise organization. This section explores key aspects associated with how cost transparency can be achieved across large Azure environments.

- Chargeback models, such as Azure App Service Environment and Azure Kubernetes Service, might need to be shared to achieve higher density. Shared platform as a service (PaaS) resources might be affected by Chargeback models.

- Use a shutdown schedule for nonproduction workloads to optimize costs.

- Use Azure Advisor to check recommendations for optimizing costs.

## Subscriptions recommendations

### Subscription organization and governance recommendations

- Treat subscriptions as a unit of management that's aligned with your business needs and priorities.

- Make subscription owners aware of their roles and responsibilities:
  - Do an access review in Azure AD Privileged Identity Management on a quarterly or yearly basis. As a result, it will ensure that privileges don't proliferate as users move within the customer organization.
  - Take full ownership of budget spending and resources.
  - Ensure policy compliance and remediate when necessary.

- Use the following principles when identifying requirements for new subscriptions:
  - **Scale limits:** Subscriptions serve as a scale unit for component workloads to scale within platform subscription limits. Large specialized workloads such as high-performance computing, IoT, and SAP should use separate subscriptions to avoid limits.
  - **Management boundary:** Subscriptions provide a management boundary for governance and isolation, which allows for a clear separation of concerns. Different environments such as development, test, and production are often removed from a management perspective.
  - **Policy boundary:** Subscriptions serve as a boundary for the assignment of Azure policies. For example, secure workloads such as PCI typically require other policies to achieve compliance. The other overhead will not be considered if a separate subscription is used. Development environments have more relaxed policy requirements than production environments.
  - **Target network topology:** Virtual networks can't be shared across subscriptions but they can connect with different technologies such as virtual network peering or Azure ExpressRoute. Consider which workloads must communicate with each other when deciding if a new subscription is required.

- Group subscriptions together under management groups, which are aligned with the management group structure and policy requirements. Grouping ensures that subscriptions with the same set of policies and Azure role assignments, come from a management group.

- Establish a dedicated management subscription in the `Platform` management group to support global management capabilities such as Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Automation runbooks.

- Establish a dedicated identity subscription in the `Platform` management group to host Windows Server Active Directory domain controllers, when necessary.

- Establish a dedicated connectivity subscription in the `Platform` management group to host an Azure Virtual WAN hub, private Domain Name System (DNS), ExpressRoute circuit, and other networking resources. A dedicated subscription ensures that all foundation network resources are billed together and isolated from other workloads.

- Avoid a rigid subscription model, and opt for a set of flexible criteria to group subscriptions across the organization. The flexibility ensures that as your organization's structure and workload composition changes, you can create new subscription groups instead of using a fixed set of existing subscriptions. One size doesn't fit all for subscriptions and what works for one business unit might not work for another. Some applications might coexist within the same landing zone subscription, while others might require their own subscription.

  - See [How do we handle "dev/test/production" workload landing zones in enterprise-scale architecture?](../../enterprise-scale/faq.md#how-do-we-handle-devtestproduction-workload-landing-zones-in-enterprise-scale-architecture) for further guidance about this point.

### Subscription quota and capacity recommendations

- Use subscriptions as scale units and scale out resources and subscriptions, as required. Your workload might then use the required resources for scaling out, without hitting subscription limits in the Azure platform.

- Use reserved instances to manage capacity in some regions. Your workload might then have the required capacity for high demand resources in a specific region.

- Establish a dashboard with custom views to monitor used capacity levels, and set up alerts if capacity is reaching critical levels (of 90 percent CPU usage).

- Raise support requests for quota increases under subscription provisioning (for example, total available VM cores within a subscription). You might then ensure that your quota limits are set before your workloads exceed the default limits.

- Ensure that your required services and features are available within the chosen deployment regions.

### Subscription tenant transfer restriction recommendations

- Configure these settings to help prevent users from transferring Azure subscriptions to or from the Azure AD tenant:

  - **Subscription leaving Azure AD directory** set to `Permit no one`.

  - **Subscription entering Azure AD directory** set to `Permit no one`.

- Configure a limited set of [exempted users](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/manage-azure-subscription-policy#exempted-users).

  - Include members from an Azure PlatformOps (platform operations) team.

  - Include break-glass accounts in the list of [exempted users](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/manage-azure-subscription-policy#exempted-users).
